Hello! The following explains what order to run the files in 
https://github.com/nmmacdo/econ771-ee3.git to replicate my work for 
assignment 3.

Step 1: Perform the analysis.

Open "analysis/main.do", change the working directory on line 19, and run.

Step 2: Compile the results.

Figures 1-5 will be saved in the results subfolder and can be readily uploaded 
into Overleaf. Tables 1-3 are not automated, so you will need to manually prepare
the tables and input the results generated from "analysis/main.do".
